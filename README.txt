Project Title: Lyft Ride GUI

Description: This is a Lyft Ride GUI application that calculates the price of the
lift ride.

https://github.com/Aerionnas/LyftRide

Languages used: Java (Java Swing)

For this project, I only used 1 file, the LyftRideCalculator.java. I included
multiple JPanels, JTextAreas, and JButton. The formula for the Lyft ride is
5+(3*distance)+(0.2*time). The user is able to manually enter the distance (in miles)
and time (in minutes). In order to calculate the total, the user has to press the
"calculate pay" button.

In my Github repositories, I have another separate program, Lyft Ride. I hope
to some how link these two projects together because it is dealing with the same
subject.

To run this project, simply compile the LyftRide.java file and run it in the
terminal.
